# In Search of Negative Space

## Vol. 2: July 1 - July 8

*I'm a workaholic and only feel satisfied when I'm creating  ... There's no way I can keep working at this unsustainable pace.*

My mind has been vacillating over these thoughts for the last week. I wake up each morning at 6:40 am, slide out of bed and shower by 7, head downstairs to pack camera gear for the day at 7:30, set up AV equipment for check-in at 8:30, and then work non-stop through the day until I can escape work by 9:00 at night (at the earliest). I feel validated and purposeful when I'm working and society idolizes *the grind*, so work quells the nagging question of "what should I be doing right now?"

For a low-paying internship, these hours are ludicrous. I've worked over 90 hours this week and have hardly had time to do more than meet my body's biological requirements - chug Soylent while walking out the door, shower upon arrival after work, and then head straight to sleep around 10:00 after meditating (my one act of daily self-care). *Is this what real life is like?* God, I sure hope not. 

I've lived in Detroit three weeks and have already been inundated in the culture of  "Detroit hustles harder." What does it feel like though to be on the constant *hustle* for a few weeks straight? Exhausting, for one. I look like an extra for *The Walking Dead.* My mind is fried and I've resorted to curt, Hemingway-esque prose. On paper and in my body I can't keep this up. 

I love to work, though, but not with this level of sustained intensity. Without space to breathe and decompress, I'm devouring information with no time to digest. When I stop for a second to breathe, my mind is flooded with thoughts and ideas that have been tucked away waiting for a quiet moment to reveal themselves.

### Meditation

Meditation has provided me with that space. It is my daily respite - the one thing I do each day *just for me.* And it's amazing what thoughts bubble up when I take time to quiet my mind. I get a lot of half-baked, vaguely poetic thoughts like "I move through places but don't let places through me." Sometimes a poem will emerge, fully-formed as if it has been knocking on the door of my mind for ages but the noise inside has been too loud for me to hear the knocking. 

At the reccomendation of Professor Gelsdorf, my advisor for Public Policy, I have been reading Jack Kornfield's *Meditation for Beginners* and practicing "lovingkindness" meditation. I have been a fan of meditation for probably four years now and while I see great returns from daily practice it has been difficult to prioritize meditating when it feels like I have so much more *work* to do. 

Meditation is *the negative.* It provides distance and separation from *the positive* - all of the daily work, activities, hobbies, and things that I do every day that make me feel like I'm working towards something. Meditation is like the rests in a musical piece - it provides space which gives form and structure to the rest. 

### July 4th - Relaxation

What better way to celebrate America's Independence Day than to escape to Canada for the day? More specifically, to Pinery Provincial Park in southwest Ontario, a Wes Anderson-esque park replete with low-slung wooden buildings, sage canoes, awkward bespectacled Canadian camp counselors, and surely a sepia-toned youth love story happening along the Old Ausable River.

It's the type of place you take your kids when you need a break from a long week at work and you just want to somewhere *wholesome*. And that's pretty much what I was doing. After being pummeled by week 1 of Training Camp, four other interns and I stuffed our bags and headed northeast from Detroit towards our destination. 

The park is situated along the southeast bank of Lake Hudson and has miles and miles of beaches and sand dunes to explore. We chose the beaches - the Canadian species not resembling the Floridian Emerald Coast that I've been raised on. Instead of emerald water and broad, blazing white beaches there was turquoise water and skinny, stone-covered beaches. 

Yet, I was standing on the fringe of an enormous lake and not the Gulf of Mexico. As such, the water was not full of the gritty sand that coats your skin and rubs it raw, but the water in Lake Huron was pure and silky. We walked out to a sand bar about 40 feet from the water's edge and dove beneath the water to take underwater portraits of each other putting my new phone to the test. 

For the first time in ages, I was just having fun with photography. None of us cared about the results but we were just giggling like children diving into the waves, trying to hold our eyes open to smile at the camera, playing around with portrait mode and underwater selfies and videos and live photos and all of these features that just felt *fun*. 

I have been a proffesional photographer for over half a decade now and much of the photography I do is for work. Very rarely do I still go out and just fool around with a camera for the fun of the process and with little regard for the end result. 

Standing there in the brisk waters of Lake Huron, shielding my phone's screen from the harsh midday sun to show the interns the underwater videos I had filmed, and seeing their eyes light up reminded me of the initial spark I had for taking photos. 

### Wrap-Up

After years of proffesional photography, I stripped the fun from my original passion and turned it into another avenue of work. This week I have been inundated with work and have had little time for me aside from my brief meditation sessions. In that one day escape, I caught a glimpse of the negative space that I needed. Away from work, away from deadlines and task-driven *hustling* I was reminded that I still hold a capacity for fun and child-like wonder. 

I haven't lost the spark that drew me to photography and I still love what I do for Venture for America even though I don't love the quantity of it. And finally, here is the poem that was knocking all week. 

> We move through places / but don't let them move through us.
>
> Breathe in this air / that has touched the walls around you.
>
> Savor yourself on your tongue / and hold the world in your lungs. 
>
> We move through the world. / Let it move through us. 
>
> One breath at a time.

With love,
