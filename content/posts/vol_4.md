# Tilt Your Head Back and Laugh at the Sky

## Vol. 4 - July 16th to 23rd : 2018


*I'm afraid that I will run out of words. That I'll get deeper into my meditation practice and realize that I have nothing left to say. My life will be defined by how I live it, and not how I archive and talk about it.*

And yet, I am compelled to catalogue my existence. I am compelled to break my life up into bite-sized articles, poems, and journal entries and chuck these out onto the internet where anyone can find them. My ego is hungry. I want to feel that my life has solidity and heft to it and leaving breadcrumbs of creation allows me to feel that I am making progress towards something. 

These acts of creation are like horcruxes that I scatter throughout the world so that who I am is not just confined to my body. /meta

### "So, how was your week?"

It was really good, thanks for asking! Work at VFA has been more relaxed as I've created a more defined role for myself and focused my effort on projects that I care about. Additionally, I've used photography as a way to explore the city on a deeper level. On Thursday, the VFA board came to Training Camp and I was with them all day taking photoos. We had a packed day of travelling around the city and learning about the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Detroit.

### Detroit & Small Business

In short, I learned that Detroit is a great city to start a business. There are countless way to get grants and early capital (such as [NEI](https://neweconomyinitiative.org/)), organizations built to provide support to turn ideas into feasible businesses ([Build Institute](http://buildinstitute.org/)), and affordable coworking and maker's spaces for once your business gets off the ground ([TechTown](https://techtowndetroit.org/services/space/) and [Ponyride](https://www.ponyride.org/)). In short, the city wants small businesses to succeed and provides the support needed to make that happen. 

Take [The Empowerment Plan](http://www.empowermentplan.org/) for example. The Empowerment Plan is a Detroit-based non-profit [that hires previously homeless women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi0fHDblOzU) to make sleeping bag coats primarily for homeless people. These are versatile coats that can be used as a sleeping bag at night, coat in the colder months, and turned into an over-the-shoulder bag for use in summer. These coats have been used by homeless people in all 50 states, in Japan after a devestating tsunami displaced thousands, and they are now being used by affected populations of the ongoing Refugee Crisis. 

This started as a project for founder Veronika Scott's Industrial Design program at The College for Creative Studies in Detroit and turned into a multi-national non-profit thanks to local partnersnhips, donations, and support. I was inspired by this organization's work and I would love to follow in Veronika's footsteps. 

### Mindful Moment of the Week

The Detroit Institute of Art is my new "happy place." I spent all of Saturday afternoon wandering through the galleries, standing in awe at the breathatking American landscape paintings of Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, and listening to Beach House's album *7*. With my earbuds in, I was lost in my own word. I glided through the museum like I was in a movie and not rooted in reality. I spent 45 minutes meditating in front of landscape paintings and drawing in my journal. 

I don't need much to be content. With a pen, journal, museum, and music I've got the basic ingredients of a delicious day. I've been in Detroit for almost two months now and my favorite moments here have been the simplest ones - diving off bridges on Belle Isle to swim in the Detroit River, taking underwater selfies in Lake Huron, morning meditation in my room at Rebirth, going for runs with Kristy to explore the city, drinking tea and reading in Hamtramck, teaching Zion to ride a bike (#dadgoals). 

This desire and appreciation for simplicity has been a constant in my life. Whether I'm home in Alabama or [living in Tokyo](http://blog.chandlercollins.com/japan-and-the-curse-of-the-traveler/) or at school in Charlottesville, the moments that I value are the ones that can happen anywhere. I don't need anything fancy in my life to be happy. I just need a few basics and then *make the choice* to be content with what I have. 

There is a quote from Buddha that captures this choice - "When you realize how perfect everything is, you will tilt your head back and laugh at the sky." 

## Upcoming

My time in Detroit is winding down. I have 12 days remaining until I make the long drive south to home. This upcoming weekend, I'll go and visit Clayton for a relaxing weekend in Connecticut and in August I'll head to Iceland with Madeline. I have so much to be grateful for and I remind myself of that each and every day. I have fears and insecurities of course, but overall, I am profoundly content. I'll close with a recent poem of mine about this feeling. 

> there is no dessert -
>
> the pounding bass,
>
> floorboard creaks next door,
>
> rain-soaked tungsten shadows
>
> dancing through the blinds,
>
> and the cold, wrinkled leather 
>
> wrapped against your spine
>
> are the only ingredients
>
> to prepare the dish - 
>
> “happiness”


With love,
