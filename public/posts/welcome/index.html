<h1 id="introduction-to-30you"><em>Introduction to 30You</em></h1>

<p>&ldquo;To know thyself is the beginning of wisdom&rdquo; is a famous quote often attributed to Socrates. By being here, you are making a decision to invest in yourself to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. There are many different reasons you may want to understand your own nature - increased happiness, better decision-making, self-control, tolerance and empathy for others, desire for a sense of satisfaction - and whatever reason you align with, I hope that this program will help you to reach your definition of success.</p>

<p>Before we begin, I think it&rsquo;s important to define what it means to &ldquo;know yourself.&rdquo;  There are many different facets of self-knowledge - understanding our minds, our emotions, our own goals, our unique attributes and skills, and our place in society - so it’s important to have a structured framework to guide . The framework that we’ll be working with is “VITAL Signs.” The capital letters form an acronym for the 6 building blocks of Self, or VITALS, for short. The letters stand for the following: Values; Interests; Temperament; Around-the-Clock; Life Mission &amp; Goals; and Strengths/Skills.</p>

<h2 id="vitals-explained">VITALS Explained</h2>

<p>”Values”- such as “family-first” or “being creative” or “financial independence” -  are your bedrock beliefs. They direct behavior and shape what we deem important. We are shaped by our values often without our conscious awareness of them. Recognition and explicit labeling of our values is the first step in the journey towards understanding ourselves.
“Interests” include hobbies, passions, and anything else that draws your attention over a sustained period of time. “Temperament” describes your naturally predisposed behavioral style. It is an inborn trait that you are born with and can shape, but not change altogether. Temperament such as “feisty” or “flexible” shape your responses and reactions to your environment.
“Around-the-clock” refers to when you like to do things. A basic example of this is whether your a morning or night person. If you know your body’s natural schedule, you can more effectively plan your days. Despite the fact that I am only 20 years old, I find that I have the biorhythms of a 80 year old. Since accepting that I should be asleep by 10pm and up by 6 every morning my mood and productivity has increased dramatically. To steal a quote from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/changepower/201603/know-yourself-6-specific-ways-know-who-you-are">Psychology Today</a>, “It’s easier to enjoy life when you don’t waste energy pretending to be someone you aren’t.”
“Life mission &amp; goals” is rather self-explanatory. Having a clearly-defined mission and goals informs your self-identity, career, and your own metrics of satisfaction and success in life.</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up Next</h2>

<p>More broadly, we can divide these categories into two basic sections - “self-centered” and “society-centered,” depending on whether we’re focusing on understanding ourselves in isolation or understanding how we fit into our social and career contexts. Through the coming prompts, we’ll unpack each of these 6 building blocks and work to put them together into a cohesive story of who you are. Getting to know yourself is a bit like building a stained glass mural - we’ll be breaking off disparate chunks of many different colors and then putting them back together into a cohesive whole.</p>

<p>To begin, fill out the introductory survey below to get a snapshot of where you are now so that we can track your progress throughout the program. Talk to you soon!</p>
